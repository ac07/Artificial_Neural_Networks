Image Orientation Detection using Artificial Neural Network.

Specifics of implementation include:
  
  ➔ Implemented both Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent 
  ➔ Cross Entropy Function and Least mean square errors used
  ➔ Weight Initialization using normalized Gaussians 
  ➔ Weight Decay using L2 Regularization 
  ➔ Up to 73% accuracy achieved   

Training dataset comprises 10k images in 4 orientations (rotated through 0,90,180 and 270 degrees) - up to 40k images
Test dataset comprises 1k images
